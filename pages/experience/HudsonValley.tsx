            When I first enrolled in community college, I entered the undecided program. Throughout 
            the next two years, I would discover my interest in programming, and lay a strong foundation 
            for my transfer to university.
          </p>

          <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
          <p>
            The only interest I had that could be a valid study in college was building computers. Because of 
            this and the fact that my dad is a software engineer, I decided to take an introductory computer science 
            course. I enjoyed the hardware side of things, and struggled with the software since it was all 
            brand new. After this semester, I switched from undecided to computer science, and truly began my journey. 
            I still didn't know what part of computer science, but at least I had narrowed it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my second semester, I took an introductory programming course in Python. I took it online, and didn't really maximize 
            what I learned, instead taking every possible shortcut to get an A. I still thought the material was interesting, I 
            just had the mindset that good grades were more important than actual learning. I especially liked that programming was a 
            skill I could develop over time, like levelling up in a video game, but unfortunately I didn't do much levelling up here.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my first 2 semesters, the 4.0 was intact, and I was all in on computer science. Despite this, 
            I struggled with discipline, especially in online courses. It hadn't caught up to me yet, but sophomore 
            year was looming...
          </p>

          <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
          <p>
            With all of the introductory courses out of the way, it was time to get to the good stuff. In my first semester, 
            the main courses on the radar was Calc 2, and Programming and Data Logic 2 (HVCC's version of data structures). After 
            the first week, I realized there was no way I could pass Calc 2, so I switched to Calc 1, despite already having credit for 
            it in high school. These two courses would turn out to be a driving force in what made me take school seriously.
          </p>
          <h3>Calculus 1</h3>
          <p>
            "I already took this in high school so its going to be a breeze, right?" Wrong. Very wrong. Here was the course's grade breakdown:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Exams:</b> 100%</li>
            </ul>
            If I wanted to succeed, I had to dig deep and have rock solid study habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received an 82 on the first exam, which wasn't a bad start. I wasn't too worried about losing my 4.0 here since math is tough, 
            but I wanted to get a B or higher. Unfortunately, the next few exams didn't go so well, dropping my average to 
            the low 70s heading into the final. since Hudson Valley is generally considered an easier school and they don't use 
            +/- grades, you have to get at least a C to receive credit for a course. I just needed above a 70 on the final to make it 
            through and receive credit. This was the last notification I received from the course:
          </p>
          <p>
            I failed a class for the first time, and would have to take Calc 1 once again. That is what I thought until I checked DegreeWorks. Since I already had 
            credit for the course and HVCC has a forgiving retake policy, my transcript took the old grade, rather than the new one. Somehow, I 
            still had a 4.0, and all of my struggles were in vain. Despite all this, I still learned a good amount, and promised myself that I would 
            never fall so far behind again, especially with Calc 2 next semester.
          </p>
          <h3>Programming and Data Logic 2</h3>
          <p>
            Another online course. The language was Java, and there was a vast amount of foundational programming concepts 
            covered here. 
          </p>
          <h3>The Final Semester</h3>
          <p>
            After making it through my third semester with the 4.0 still intact, it was time to finish strong. I was taking 20 credits, with the 
            key courses being Calc 2, Assembly Language, and Discrete Mathematics. 
          </p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Hudson Valley Community College laid the foundation for my academic journey at RPI. Looking back, I 
            sometimes ponder how things might have turned out if I was at RPI from the very beginning. 
            Even so, given the chance, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing. I saved a boatload of money, figured out my interests, 
            learned valuable lessons, and was able to work 30 hours per week the entire time.
