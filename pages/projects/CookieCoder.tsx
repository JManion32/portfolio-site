                Cookie Coder is the site I wish I had when I was first learning how to code. It 
                will feature a wide range of languages including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, 
                PHP, SQL, and more, and take a fresh approach to traditional module-based learning. 
                Instead of rigid lessons, users will answer questions from a large pool of interactive, flashcard-style 
                questions. As they answer correctly, they’ll earn “bits,” an in-game 
                currency that tracks progress and ranks players on global leaderboards. The more 
                bits they accumulate, the larger their pool grows, and the harder their questions become.

            <h2>Core Idea: Learning Code through Repetition</h2>
            <p>
                Learning is continuous, occurring over time. Think about studying 
                for an exam. Cramming all the material the night before <b>does not work</b>. It is far more effective 
                to study multiple times over a week. In the same way, learning a programming language isn't 
                possible from just a single online course. A foundation of knowledge needs to be established, and 
                reinforced with repetition. This is what Cookie Coder aims to do through <i>fluid</i> modular learning.
            </p>
            <h3>Interactive Flashcard-Style Questions</h3>
            <p>
                The standard gamplay. These questions will be simple (multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, etc), 
                enabling the user to rapid-fire cycle through them. 
                For each programming language, the user will start with 300 of these questions and accumulate more, higher level 
                ones as they advance in the game. Rather than having set modules, questions will be from the entire pool, and 
                their bits will determine the chance they have of being pulled.
            </p>
            <h3>Coding Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                After accumulating bits, the user will be able to risk them on coding challenges. They will face an open-ended question 
                and have to write code that passes all test cases before the timer runs out. Each correct answer will double their winnings, 
                but if they fail, they lose it all!

                  The cornerstone of my studies. The reptition it offers has prepared me

                <h3>Make it Rain!</h3>
                <p>
                  Features repetitive, tycoon-style gameplay, as well as a risk component where 
                  users have to solve puzzles to multiply their earnings. Growing up, I spent hundreds

                <p>
                  If you haven't heard of this site, I would describe it as competitive flashcards. 
                  It features the same tycoon-style gameplay that made learning fun and effective.

                <p>
                  This was my go-to website when I was learning how to code. It features 
                  interactive flashcard-style questions as well as coding challenges.

                <p>
                  This always inspires my projects in one way or another. I plan to adopt a similar multi-language backend architecture 
                  where one language is for general application logic and the other is for dedicated to worker processes.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                There is much to consider with this project. How large do I want to scale the MVP? Should I 
                integrate AI? What will deployment look like? For now, I am going to stick to the core question 
                structure, tycoon gameplay, and leaderboard integration. With this, I can gauge interest, and decide 
                where to go next.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the technologies I plan to use, they are similar to <a onClick={() => navigateTop("/projects/speedroulette")}>Speed Roulette</a>, 
              but with a few exceptions. I'm no longer a fan of Tailwind and Bootstrap, so I am going to just use vanilla CSS. I’ve also decided to use 
              two backend languages: Node.js for handling general application logic and Go for performance-critical worker processes. Lastly, I'm saying 
              goodbye to Digital Ocean in favor of AWS since this will be a more complex application, and I need the experience.
